R scripts for the K2C vegetation change analysis
- 1_DataPrep.R: Calculates residuals between vegetation and rainfall time-series datasets and k-means clusters.
- 2_MeanVariance_Plots.R: Creates mean-variance plots.
- 3_PERMANOVA.R: Calculates distance metrics and runs Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA).
- 4_NMDS_Plots.R: Visualizs clusters across coordinate space using Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) plots.
- 5_TimeSeries_Plots.R: Plot vegetation-rainfall residuals over time (Early, Transition, Late), symbolized by Management Type (Closed, Open, KNP).
